OAuth2 API client based on Yii framework.

## Requirement

## Starting your first clone

### After cloning please rename this following file :

- ```index.default.php``` to ```index.php```
- ```protected/yiic.default.php``` to ```protected/yiic.php```
- ```protected/config/console.default.php``` to ```protected/config/console.php```
